Interactive web map for visualizing and comparing regional risk levels across Nigeria. Users can select two locations, view highlighted boundaries, inspect risk ranges, and download structured PDF comparison reports. Includes reset-to-Nigeria view, dynamic legend, major roads overlay, and automated snapshot rendering.
Here is a very detailed explanation, longer than 350 characters, covering every feature clearly:


This application provides an interactive way to analyze and compare security exposure across Nigerian regions. The Compare Region panel allows users to select a State, LGA, or Ward for Region A and Region B, retrieve underlying risk scores for all matching features, compute average scores for each region, classify them, highlight each region on the map, capture isolated snapshots, and export a structured comparison PDF containing summary text, risk implication statements, and map images.

The Search Region panel allows searching by state, LGA, or ward name. Matching results are zoomed into their exact geographic extent with highlight applied, and risk classification details are prepared for reporting.

A Reset View button repositions the map back to full Nigeria extent regardless of the previous zoom level.

The map includes a Light Basemap for visual context, Major Roads for reference mobility structure, and a categorized Legend displaying risk index ranges with their color representations.

All outputs reflect real map boundaries, and exported PDF reports contain the exact view displayed on screen. This makes it useful for planning, movement routing, reporting, and comparative analysis.
